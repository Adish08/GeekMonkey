# YouTube: Native Cobalt Downloader

A lightweight, ad-free Userscript that integrates a native-looking **Download** button directly into the YouTube interface. It redirects video links to a configurable [suspicious link removed] instance for high-quality, privacy-focused downloading.

*(You can replace this with a screenshot of the button later)*

## ✨ Features

* **Native UI Integration:** The button blends perfectly with YouTube's 2025 design language (pill shape, dark/light mode sync).
* **Privacy Focused:** Uses **Cobalt**, a clean, ad-free, and tracker-free media downloader.
* **Universal Support:** Works on standard **Videos** and **Shorts**.
* **Smart Detection:** Automatically hides the official "Download" button (which requires Premium) to reduce clutter.
* **Configurable:** Choose your own Cobalt instance (e.g., `cobalt.tools`, `cobalt.clxxped.lol`, or self-hosted).
